Theme last updated: March 12th, 2019.  
Notes: Breaks with the latest Discord Canary theme redesign. I'm not going to fix it.
# catitude.theme
My personal Discord theme, that I don't actually use because I don't want to get banned for violating the Terms of Service.
Just a hobby project.  
  
  
Please note modifying your Discord client might get you banned, and that this theme is also only tested and made to work with the desktop Dark theme.


### Executive Notes
- Port to Powercord's style manager coming soon.
- Works with BeautifulDiscord at the moment.
